## 🏫 FREE from UT Austin — Don't Buy These

These items are available at no cost through UT campus resources. Use them instead of buying.

| Item | Where | Details | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Soldering stations + solder** | Texas Inventionworks (EER 0.618) | 8 stations in Electronics Lab 1. Check out kits from The Garage. | ~$25 (Rajat already owns one too) |
| **3D printing (PETG, PLA, resin)** | TIW DFAB Lab (EER 0.602) OR Hello Maker (Welch Hall) | Free filament for UT students. Pod housings, harness clips, snap mounts. | ~$20 |
| **Sewing machines** | TIW DFAB Lab OR Hello Maker | For textile garment prototype — sewing conductive fabric into compression shirt. | ~$15 |
| **Laser cutter** | TIW Laser Lab (EER 0.602) | Cut neoprene strap padding, acrylic pod enclosures. Way cleaner than hand cutting. | — |
| **Oscilloscope + bench power supply** | TIW Electronics Lab 1 | Critical for debugging sEMG signal chain. Don't buy one. | ~$200+ avoided |
| **Heat shrink tubing** | TIW Electronics Lab | Available in The Garage supplies. | ~$5 |
| **Wire strippers, multimeter, hand tools** | TIW The Garage (EER 0.618) | Full checkout system for hand tools. | ~$20 |

**Total savings: ~$285+ in avoided purchases**

> **Access requirements:** All UT students can use TIW and Hello Maker. Most equipment requires a quick online training + in-person demo. TIW is open Mon–Fri 10am–6pm. **Do the 3D printer and soldering training ASAP** — someone on the team should knock these out tomorrow.

## 🔬 TRY TO BORROW — Cold Email These Labs This Week

This is the highest-ROI move you can make. A few hours with a research-grade Delsys system would let you validate electrode placements against gold-standard data and potentially skip buying the ADS1292R entirely.

| Lab | PI / Contact | What They Have | What to Ask For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **KHE Neuromuscular Control Lab** | Dr. Lisa Griffin (512-471-1273, KHE main office) | Multichannel surface EMG + intramuscular EMG | 2–3 hours of bench time with their sEMG system to validate electrode placements during compound lifts |
| **Clinical Biomechanics & Mobility Lab** | Dr. Hsiao-Wecksler | Surface EMG, force plates, motion capture | Same ask — frame it as interdisciplinary collaboration |
| **ReNeu Robotics Lab (ME Dept)** | Dr. Ashish Deshpande | Builds rehab wearables — closest to your project | Bench time + potential mentorship. They may have spare OpenBCI or similar boards. |
| **Human Locomotion Lab (ME Dept)** | Dr. Richard Neptune | Biomechanics + EMG during movement | Gold-standard EMG data for your target muscles during squats/deadlifts |

**Email template:** "We're a 5-person UT team building a closed-loop sEMG wearable for injury prevention during weightlifting. We have our own prototype hardware arriving this week and would love 2–3 hours of bench time with your EMG system to validate our electrode placements against a gold standard. Happy to share our data and results. Would any time this week or next work?"

> **If you get lab access:** You can potentially **skip the ADS1292R purchase ($50)** and **defer the Cerelog decision** entirely. The lab's Delsys data becomes your reference signal to benchmark your AD8232s against.

## 🏪 Local Austin Pickup — Same Day

| Store | Address | What to Get There | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Elliott Electronic Supply** | Austin, TX (call for stock) | Basic components: resistors, capacitors, wire, connectors. May have AD8232 or similar breakouts. | Walk-in, no minimum order. Call first to check stock on specific ICs. |
| **ATX Hackerspace** | Austin, TX | $75/month membership gets access to laser cutter, 3D printers, CNC mill, electronics bench. | Backup workspace if UT labs are booked. Also a good place to network with hardware folks who may have sEMG gear. |
| **CVS / Walgreens / HEB** | Everywhere | Ag/AgCl ECG electrodes (sold as cardiac monitoring pads), medical tape, isopropyl alcohol, razors | Faster than Amazon for skin prep consumables. Check the medical supplies aisle. |
| **Amazon Locker** | Various Austin locations | Everything on the Amazon buy list | Same-day or next-day pickup, no porch theft risk |

### Mouser Will-Call (Mansfield, TX)

Mouser has a will-call counter at 1000 N Main St, Mansfield, TX 76063. You can place an order online and pick it up in about an hour. It's a ~3 hour round trip from Austin, so only worth it if you need a critical-path component (like the BioAmp or ADS1292R) and can't wait for shipping. Open Mon–Fri 7am–8pm.

**When to drive to Mansfield:** Only if (a) Cerelog is sold out, AND (b) Mouser has BioAmp EXG Pill in US warehouse stock, AND (c) you need research-grade sensors before Monday. Otherwise, overnight shipping from Mansfield arrives next day anyway.

> ⚠️ **Micro Center Austin is NOT open yet.** It's slated for mid-to-late 2026 grand opening. Don't plan around it.

## WAVE 3: Reserve — Data-Driven Purchases (Days 4–6)

**Remaining budget: ~$257 across all cards**

| Item | Price | Source | Card (remaining) | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cerelog ESP-EEG (ADS1299, 8ch) | $362 | cerelog.com | **Needs card split — no single card fits** | AD8232 + ADS1292R confirmed insufficient for MDF fatigue |
| *OR* ADS1292R ×3 more (6 more ch) | $75 | SparkFun | Rajat ($85) | Need more research-grade channels |
| DRV2605L + LRA haptic driver | $32 | SparkFun | Leo ($35) | Coin vibes can't be localized on torso |
| nRF52840 DK | $40 | Mouser | Rajiv ($102) | ESP32 BLE can't handle 10ch × 500Hz |
| LessEMF A321 silver Lycra | $35 | LessEMF | Rajiv ($102) | Want higher-quality textile electrodes |
| Extra Ag/AgCl electrodes 100-pack ×2 | $16 | Amazon | Kelsi ($11) + Aaron ($5) | Burning through faster than expected |
| Pod housings | FREE | **UT TIW 3D printers** | — | Always — print at TIW, don't buy filament |

> **Cerelog note:** At $362, it exceeds any single remaining card balance. If you need it: (a) Rajat ($85) + Rajiv ($102) + Leo ($35) + Aaron ($24) = $246 — still $116 short. You'd need someone to front and get reimbursed. **(b) Better alternative:** Buy 3 more ADS1292R boards ($75) for 10 total channels of 24-bit data. Fits on Rajat's card. Less elegant than Cerelog but same signal quality per channel.
